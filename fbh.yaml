##Bot Answers

id: bot-issues-cantadd
title: "- You need Manage Server permissions in the server you want to add fredboat to.\n
- You need to log into discord in the browser version => https://discordapp.com/\n
- If you are sure that you covered both of the above, try adding the bot in an incognito/private window."

---
id: bot-issues-memberlist
title: "If you are sure that you have added the bot to your discord, but cannot see it on the right, either look for it in Server Settings > Members, or make sure it has read permissions to the text channel and category you are in."

---
id: bot-issues-notresponding
title: "If the bot is not responding to any of your messages in a given channel, make sure that it has the following permissions in both the text channel and category (dropdown menu for channels), by clicking on the channel settings:\n
    - `View Channel`\n
    - `Send Messages`\n
    - `Embed Links`\n
    - `Read Message History`"

---
id: bot-issues-notpermitted

    - `View Channel`\n
    - `Connect`\n
    - `Speak`\n
    - `Use Voice Activity`"

id: bot-issues-noaudio
title: "Most of the no audio issues that occur are because of Discord's audio node going bad. To resolve those, you'll need to change your voice region. You can do so, by going to **Voice Channel Settings** -> **Overview** -> **Region Override**. \n
If that doesn't resolve your issue, you can also try issuing the `;;destroy` command."

Also please make sure that none of the roles the bot (or `@everyone`) has Administrator permissions in Server Settings > Roles"
