##Bot Answers

id: bot-issues-cantadd
title: "- You need Manage Server permissions in the server you want to add fredboat to.\n
- You need to log into discord in the browser version => https://discordapp.com/\n
- If you are sure that you covered both of the above, try adding the bot in an incognito/private window."

---
id: bot-issues-memberlist
title: "If you are sure that you have added the bot to your discord, but cannot see it on the right, either look for it in Server Settings > Members, or make sure it has read permissions to the text channel you are in."

---
id: bot-issues-notresponding
title: "If the bot is not responding to any of your messages in a given channel, make sure that it has the following permissions, by clicking on che channel settings:\n
    - `Read Messages`\n
    - `Send Messages`\n
    - `Embed Links`\n
    - `Read Message History`"

---
id: bot-issues-notpermitted

id: bot-issues-noaudio
title: "Most of the no audio issues that occur are because of Discord's audio node going bad. To resolve those, you'll need to change your voice region. You can do so, by going to your Server settings. Please refer to the gif below, should you need further help. \n
If that doesn't resolve your issue, you can also try issuing the `;;destroy` command.\n

Check the channel description for #cutting-edge-bugs for an invite link. It is only used when we are testing a new feature... So, uptime will be spotty and is not guaranteed.\n

You can not make the Free Fredboat stay in the voice channel indefinitely. This is to conserve resources and will not be changing.
However, if you wish to have a bot that is capable of staying in the channel all the time you need to either self-host => <https://fredboat.com/docs/selfhosting>\n
Or pay for the Patron bot which is just $2 a month => https://fredboat.com/docs/donate."
